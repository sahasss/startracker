# ⭐ Star Tracker for Spacecraft Navigation

A computer vision-based Star Tracker system that identifies constellations and star patterns from sky images to assist spacecraft in autonomous navigation and attitude determination.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to simulate the core functionalities of a **Star Tracker**—a key component in satellite and spacecraft navigation systems. The tracker processes star field images using **image processing and pattern recognition** techniques to estimate the orientation of a spacecraft in space.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains star field images in `.png` format, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and stored in the `star_images/` folder.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📸 Star detection from images
- ✨ Constellation pattern recognition
- 🧮 Attitude estimation (WIP)
- 🔍 Uses OpenCV for image processing
- 📐 Intended for embedded or simulation-based navigation systems

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (planned for attitude estimation)
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) (PNG format star fields)
